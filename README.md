# rectmesh3d-m (v1.0)
A collection of utilities for 3D rectilinear mesh and model manipulation in geology and geophysics.

### Features
- Fully functional programming in MATLAB
- Minimum dependency on advanced/external toolboxes
- For the purpose of algorithm archiving and prototyping
- Designed for convenience, not for speed

### Definitions and Concepts
- A rectilinear mesh discretizes 3D space into many cuboidal **cells**;
the interfaces between adjacent cells are **faces**; each face is bounded by **edges**;
edges connect **nodes**.
- A **grid** is a lattice structure of points. Nodes of a mesh can form a grid, so do cell centers, face centers and edge centers.
- A right-handed coordinate system is adopted; A recommended geographical correspondence is x positive for east, y positive for north and z positive for upward.
- A mesh can be fully specified by three vectors **nodeX**, **nodeY** and **nodeZ**. Such a vector lists all possible x, y or z-coordinates of grid points, without recurrence of the same number. The numbers are ascending in nodeX (from west to east) and nodeY (from south to north), and descending in nodeZ (from top to bottom).
- By default, a **model** refers to a vector of numbers, each of which is assigned to a mesh cell. The convention of reshaping a 3D array to a vector is always that the z-coordinate of cell centers varies the most frequently, then the x-coordinate, and finally the y-coordinate. It is like painting walls from top to bottom, from left to right and from front to back when you are facing the southernmost wall of the mesh.
